General instructions of this repository
=======

This folder contains some code written by myself, which were used in my previous work or idea-testing procedure.
Related code will be commit gradually, and this file will also be updated then.
For each class or piece of code, I will uploaded them with demo code as possible, so that one can quickly understand how it is used.
And for most code, I was trying to make it self-annotationed, and if not I will write some explanation annotation to let one know 
what the code is doing easily.

For now, it includes follwoing code:

    1> Feature extractor using Caffe with deep learning model;
    2> MySQL connection pool class with ConnCpp library;
    3> Some function code based on OpenCV library;
    4> Makefile template used in Linux-like platform, including two version: compiling excutable binary file or shared library;
    5> Implamentation code for some basic algorithms, such as searching, sorting, and so on;
    6> Other useful fucntions which may be usualy used, such string processing, file operation.
    7> A helper tool, with which one can get video file's basic information for standard video, Hiakang video, Dahua video and Hanbang Video;(later version will add decode interface, with which users can can decoding frame from video file)
