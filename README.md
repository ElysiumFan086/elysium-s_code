# elysium-s_code

This folder contains some code written by myself, which were used in my previous work or idea-testing procedure.
Related code will be commit gradually, and this file will also be updated then.
For each class or piece of code, I will equip them with demo code as possible, so that one can quickly understand how it is used.
And for most code, I was trying to make it self-annotationed, and if not I will write some explanation annotation to let one know 
what the code is doing easily.

For now, it includes follwoing code:

1> Feature extractor using Caffe with deep learning model;
2> MySQL connection pool class with ConnCpp library;
3> Some function code based on OpenCV library;
4> Other useful fucntions which may be usualy used, such string processing, file operation.
